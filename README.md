# Assign and a print a variable

In this quick exercise, you will use the what we learned in the previous lesson to assign and print a variable. 

You may [refer to Monday's lecture notes](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/lecture-content/variables-getting-started-9-4-23.md) to complete the exercise. However, I would advise against copy-pasting, so your fingers can start to build muscle memory. 

## Instructions 
### Quick tip: right-click links and open in a new tab, so that you still have this tab open for reference! 

1. Sign in to your [trinket.io](https://trinket.io/) account
2. Create a new Python trinket by clicking the dropdown by your username on the top right then New Trinket>Python
3. Write a program that declares a variable, assigns it a value, and prints it out. That's it! 
4. Save your work, and either copy your link directly from the URL bar or use the link-share tree to the left of the Save button. 
5. Paste your link from step 4 into link.md and commit your changes.
